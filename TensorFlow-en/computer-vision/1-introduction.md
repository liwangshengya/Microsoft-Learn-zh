## Introduction to computer vision with TensorFlow

In this module, we will learn how to perform different computer vision tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. Throughout this module, we will be using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), one of the most popular library for building neural networks. We will start with an introduction to a small Dense Neural Network (DNNs), then build on that knowledge to dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lastly look at how we can use pre-trained models in transfer learning to improve our results with less data.
