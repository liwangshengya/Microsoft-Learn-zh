Each letter would correspond to a tensor in one-hot encoding.\n",
        "* **Word-level representation**, in which we create a **vocabulary** of all words in our text, and then represent words using one-hot encoding. This approach is better than character-level representation because each letter by itself does not have much meaning. By using higher-level semantic concepts - words - we simplify the task for the neural network. However, given a large dictionary size, we need to deal with high-dimensional sparse tensors.\n",
